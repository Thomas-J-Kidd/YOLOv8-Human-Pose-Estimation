    Implementing Temporal Smoothing: You can implement a form of temporal smoothing where detections are not treated
    independently frame by frame, but rather in the context of previous frames. This can be as simple as maintaining a cache 
    of recent detections and using this information to infer the presence of a person even if they are momentarily not detected.
